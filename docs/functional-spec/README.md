# Functional spec

This is the external behavior of `grund` — *what* it does, not how it's built. Each spec lives in its own file. The H1 of that file declares an `FS-<slug>` ID, and the body is its contract. Anywhere else in the tree, a citation like `§FS-<slug>.<section>` resolves back into one of these files.

## CLI commands

The subcommands a user runs on the command line.

- [§FS-check](FS-check.md#fs-check-grund-validates-every-citation-in-a-repo) — grund validates every citation in a repo
- [§FS-show](FS-show.md#fs-show-grund-reads-a-single-declaration-body-by-id) — grund reads a single declaration body by ID
- [§FS-list](FS-list.md#fs-list-grund-lists-every-declared-id) — grund lists every declared ID
- [§FS-refs](FS-refs.md#fs-refs-grund-lists-every-citation-of-an-id) — grund lists every citation of an ID
- [§FS-cover](FS-cover.md#fs-cover-grund-groups-citations-by-scanned-file) — grund groups citations by scanned file
- [§FS-cochange-recipe](FS-cochange-recipe.md#fs-cochange-recipe-an-opt-in-git-recipe-reports-related-declaration-and-test-edits) — an opt-in Git recipe reports related declaration and test edits
- [§FS-fmt](FS-fmt.md#fs-fmt-grund-normalizes-citations-in-bulk) — grund normalizes citations in bulk
- [§FS-init](FS-init.md#fs-init-grund-bootstraps-a-new-grund-conformant-repo) — grund bootstraps a new grund-conformant repo
- [§FS-id](FS-id.md#fs-id-grund-proposes-ids-for-new-declarations) — grund proposes IDs for new declarations
- [§FS-completions](FS-completions.md#fs-completions-grund-completes-declared-ids-in-shells) — grund completes declared IDs in shells
- [§FS-fetch](FS-fetch.md#fs-fetch-grund-materializes-one-external-fact-snapshot) — grund materializes one external fact snapshot

## Editor integration

The editor surface — an optional LSP server that any LSP-aware editor can talk to. No first-party per-editor plugins ship; configuration is the user's one-time work.

- [§FS-lsp](FS-lsp.md#fs-lsp-grund-ships-an-optional-lsp-server) — grund ships an optional LSP server
- [§FS-integrations](FS-integrations.md#fs-integrations-grund-prints-and-installs-its-rendering-layer-integrations) — grund prints and installs its rendering-layer integrations

## Packaging

How `grund` is shipped.

- [§FS-distribution](FS-distribution.md#fs-distribution-grund-distribution-targets) — grund distribution targets
- [§FS-distribution-candidate](FS-distribution-candidate.md#fs-distribution-candidate-one-candidate-is-assembled-rehearsed-and-verified-before-any-registry-sees-it) — one candidate is assembled, rehearsed and verified before any registry sees it

## The ground

What holds for the model itself, whichever command reads it. A check `grund check` enforces is a section of the spec whose ground it defends, named by the finding code it reports ([§REQ-spec-section-names.code](../requirements/REQ-spec-section-names.md#code-a-check-is-named-by-its-diagnostic-code)).

- [§FS-declarations](FS-declarations.md#fs-declarations-a-declaration-is-addressable-once-from-one-allowed-place-and-holds-nothing-that-is-neither-a-coordinate-nor-a-finding) — a declaration is addressable once, from one allowed place, and holds nothing that is neither a coordinate nor a finding

## Cross-cutting

Behavior every subcommand inherits.

- [§FS-cli](FS-cli.md#fs-cli-grunds-command-line-surface-conventions) — grund's command-line surface conventions
- [§FS-errors](FS-errors.md#fs-errors-grund-emits-messages-in-fixed-shapes) — grund emits messages in fixed shapes
- [§FS-output-shapes](FS-output-shapes.md#fs-output-shapes-machine-readable-output-shapes) — machine-readable output shapes
- [§FS-values](FS-values.md#fs-values-opted-in-kinds-bind-authored-components-to-one-declared-value) — opted-in kinds bind authored components to one declared value
- [§FS-rules](FS-rules.md#fs-rules-grounded-declarations-state-and-enforce-chapter-rules) — grounded declarations state and enforce chapter rules

## Vocabulary

The words the specs share, settled once so a slice read alone still reads alone.

- [§FS-terms](FS-terms.md#fs-terms-the-shared-vocabulary-of-the-functional-spec-and-the-architecture) — the shared vocabulary of the functional spec and the architecture

## Verbose fixtures

Concrete fixtures that keep the command specs readable while pinning exact examples.

- [§FS-examples](FS-examples.md#fs-examples-examples-teach-canonical-user-workflows) — examples teach canonical user workflows
- [§FS-init-fixtures](FS-init-fixtures.md#fs-init-fixtures-concrete-init-fixtures) — concrete init fixtures

## Configuration and scope

- [§FS-config](FS-config.md#fs-config-grund-reads-a-toml-config-file-found-by-walking-up) — grund reads a TOML config file found by walking up
- [§FS-config-v2](FS-config-v2.md#fs-config-v2-grund-reads-a-version-2-config-by-concern-with-one-strength-vocabulary-and-fixed-defaults) — grund reads a version-2 config by concern, with one strength vocabulary and fixed defaults
- [§FS-inline-citation-style](FS-inline-citation-style.md#fs-inline-citation-style-configurable-shape-of-inline-code-comment-citations) — configurable shape of inline code-comment citations
- [§FS-workspace](FS-workspace.md#fs-workspace-grund-validates-cross-project-citations-in-a-workspace) — grund validates cross-project citations in a workspace
- [§FS-remote-projects](FS-remote-projects.md#fs-remote-projects-a-project-cites-another-repositorys-declarations-from-a-committed-pinned-projection) — a project cites another repository's declarations from a committed, pinned projection
- [§FS-non-goals](FS-non-goals.md#fs-non-goals-what-grund-will-deliberately-not-do) — what grund will deliberately not do

## Repository maintenance

- [§FS-repository-maintenance](FS-repository-maintenance.md#fs-repository-maintenance-checkout-maintenance-stays-discoverable) — checkout maintenance stays discoverable
