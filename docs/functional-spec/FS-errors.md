# FS-errors: grund emits messages in fixed shapes

This spec defines the style every `grund` subcommand uses when it speaks to a user or to a downstream tool. It is cross-cutting: [§FS-check](FS-check.md#fs-check-grund-validates-every-citation-in-a-repo), [§FS-show](FS-show.md#fs-show-grund-reads-a-single-declaration-body-by-id), [§FS-list](FS-list.md#fs-list-grund-lists-every-declared-id), [§FS-refs](FS-refs.md#fs-refs-grund-lists-every-citation-of-an-id), [§FS-cover](FS-cover.md#fs-cover-grund-groups-citations-by-scanned-file), [§FS-fmt](FS-fmt.md#fs-fmt-grund-normalizes-citations-in-bulk), [§FS-fetch](FS-fetch.md#fs-fetch-grund-materializes-one-external-fact-snapshot), [§FS-init](FS-init.md#fs-init-grund-bootstraps-a-new-grund-conformant-repo), [§FS-id](FS-id.md#fs-id-grund-proposes-ids-for-new-declarations), [§FS-config](FS-config.md#fs-config-grund-reads-a-toml-config-file-found-by-walking-up), and [§FS-completions](FS-completions.md#fs-completions-grund-completes-declared-ids-in-shells) all conform to it, and the global-flag behaviour in [§FS-cli](FS-cli.md#fs-cli-grunds-command-line-surface-conventions) routes its errors through [§FS-errors.2.2](FS-errors.md#22-cli-level-message) here. Serves [§GOAL-friendliness-first.1](../goals.md#1-hard-requirements) (errors point at the line, no surprises) and [§GOAL-no-silent-breakage.1](../goals.md#1-what-counts-as-user-visible) (the message shapes are user-visible output).

The shapes are **frozen** by the same logic as [§FS-non-goals.9](FS-non-goals.md#9-severity-exit-code-or-report-ordering-customization): two correctly-configured installs must agree on what they print. A subcommand that needs to say something new picks one of the shapes below; it does not invent an ad hoc one.

For verbose implementer examples of JSON objects, empty-output behavior, stream split, and ordering, see [§FS-output-shapes](FS-output-shapes.md#fs-output-shapes-machine-readable-output-shapes). This file defines the general rules; that appendix pins representative wire examples.

## terms: Terms

Leans on [§FS-terms.terms.1](FS-terms.md#terms1-declarations-and-coordinates) (declaration, ID, kind, home, body, section, catalog),
[§FS-terms.terms.2](FS-terms.md#terms2-citations) (citation, shorthand), [§FS-terms.terms.3](FS-terms.md#terms3-source-forms) (stub), [§FS-terms.terms.4](FS-terms.md#terms4-scanning-and-project-structure) (scan,
scope, workspace, member, alias), [§FS-terms.terms.5](FS-terms.md#terms5-findings) (finding, severity, suggestion, caution,
verdict), [§FS-terms.terms.6](FS-terms.md#terms6-rules-and-directions) (rule), and [§FS-terms.terms.7](FS-terms.md#terms7-values-and-integrations) (value, binding, snapshot).

- **located finding** — A finding about the repository, printed with its `<path>:<line>: `
  prefix — as against a CLI-level message, which is about the run and carries no location.
- **code catalog** — The sorted, published set of `check` finding codes. A compound of this
  file's own: it is not the declaration catalog.
- **report base** — The directory every `path` in a report is rendered against, selected by
  `--path-base` when it is passed, else by `relative_paths`.

## 1. Streams

`grund` follows the **linter convention** (`eslint`, `ruff`, `shellcheck`, `golangci-lint`): a checker's findings *are* its output, so they go to **stdout** — `grund check | grep …`, `grund check > findings.txt`, and `grund check --format=json | jq …` all work with no stream redirection. `stderr` is reserved for what the command says *about* the run, not *as* its output. What stdout carries is [§FS-errors.1.1](FS-errors.md#11-what-stdout-carries), and what stderr carries is [§FS-errors.1.2](FS-errors.md#12-what-stderr-carries).

The two are never mixed: `grund check 2>/dev/null` shows you the findings and only the findings; `grund check >/dev/null` shows you only the run-level errors; `grund <ID> | …` is the body and nothing else.

### 1.1 What stdout carries

**stdout** carries the command's output:

- a query result — the body printed by `grund <ID>`, the catalog from `grund list`, the citations from `grund refs`, the file graph from `grund cover`, the ID from `grund id`, the config from `grund config show`;
- a checker report — every located finding from `grund check` ([§FS-check.2.1](FS-check.md#21-report-format)), the text-mode `success` line from a clean `grund check`, and the would-change / did-change report from `grund fmt` ([§FS-fmt.3](FS-fmt.md#3-outputs)).
- `grund check --format=json` is findings-only: on success with nothing to report, stdout is empty.

### 1.2 What stderr carries

**stderr** carries everything else:

- `error:` lines — a launch-time failure or an I/O failure that means the run could not do its job ([§FS-errors.2.2](FS-errors.md#22-cli-level-message)), always with a non-zero exit;
- `warning:` lines about the run itself, not its content — e.g. an empty scan ([§FS-check.2.2](FS-check.md#22-empty-scan)) — exit unchanged;
- `note:` / `hint:` recovery breadcrumbs ([§FS-refs.2](FS-refs.md#2-behaviour), [§FS-show.3.4](FS-show.md#34-what-a-failed-query-prints));
- the bare message a *failed query* prints when it has no result to put on stdout ([§FS-errors.2.3](FS-errors.md#23-bare-query-failure) — an ID query on a missing ID);
- `grund init`'s file-by-file transcript ([§FS-errors.6](FS-errors.md#6-the-grund-init-transcript) — `init`'s real output is the scaffold on disk; the transcript is progress), and `grund integrations --write`'s transcript in the same shape ([§FS-errors.6](FS-errors.md#6-the-grund-init-transcript)).

## 2. The Fixed Shapes

### 2.1 Located finding

A finding that points at a specific source site:

```
<path>:<line>: <message>
<path>:<line>: <channel>: <message>
```

- `<path>` is rendered against the report base that `--path-base` selects, else `relative_paths` ([§FS-cli.3.4](FS-cli.md#34---path-base--where-report-paths-are-spelled-from), [§FS-config.3.6](FS-config.md#36-output--report-format)).
- `<line>` is 1-indexed.
- `<channel>` is the lowercase `error`, `warning`, or `suggestion` prefix used
  by `grund check`; other commands omit it.
- `<message>` is a single line — no embedded newlines, no terminal period — and
  does not include the channel prefix.
- The `<path>:<line>:` prefix is mandatory: editors and agents jump on this exact shape.

Emitted on **stdout** — it is the command's output ([§FS-errors.1.1](FS-errors.md#11-what-stdout-carries)). Which form each command uses is [§FS-errors.2.1.1](FS-errors.md#211-which-form-each-command-uses).

#### 2.1.1 Which form each command uses

Every finding from
`grund check` uses the channel-bearing form ([§FS-check.2.1](FS-check.md#21-report-format)); every would-change line from `grund fmt` ([§FS-fmt.3](FS-fmt.md#3-outputs)) and every citation from `grund refs` ([§FS-refs.3.1](FS-refs.md#31---format-text-default)) keeps the channel-less form. The optional LSP server likewise keeps its existing diagnostic content ([§FS-lsp.1.1](FS-lsp.md#11-diagnostics)); the CLI text prefix does not become part of an LSP message. The `<path>:<line>:` prefix is shared; the command, stream, and `check` channel distinguish the meanings.

### 2.2 CLI-level message

A line that is about the *run*, not a finding at a site in the repo:

```
error: <message>
warning: <message>
```

- On **stderr** ([§FS-errors.1.2](FS-errors.md#12-what-stderr-carries)) — it is not the command's output.
- The literal leading `error: ` / `warning: ` prefix is what distinguishes a
  CLI-level message from a located finding, whose severity prefix follows its
  `<path>:<line>:` prefix. CI scripts grep for the leading `error:` to tell a
  launch-time failure from a clean run that found findings on stdout.

Where the message text still carries a location is [§FS-errors.2.2.1](FS-errors.md#221-a-location-inside-the-message-text); the exit code each prefix accompanies is [§FS-errors.2.2.2](FS-errors.md#222-exit-codes); who uses the shape is [§FS-errors.2.2.3](FS-errors.md#223-who-uses-it); how it renders under `--format=json` is [§FS-errors.2.2.4](FS-errors.md#224-under---formatjson).

#### 2.2.1 A location inside the message text

The `<path>:<line>:` *prefix* a located finding wears ([§FS-errors.2.1](FS-errors.md#21-located-finding)) is never used
here — a line beginning with that prefix is the signal of a per-site finding
on stdout, whether a `check` channel prefix or the message follows it. The
message *text* may still carry a location: a `grund.toml` schema error is
reported `error: <path>:<line>: <message>` ([§FS-config.4.3](FS-config.md#43-invalid-config-behavior)) — the leading `error:` marks it CLI-level (stderr, non-zero exit), and the `<path>:<line>:` inside the text is the breadcrumb to the bad line, since a config file has one where a bad flag does not. Other CLI-level messages carry a location in the text the same way when they have one — a config line (`warning: b/grund.toml:3: …`, which is what [§FS-check.3.29](FS-check.md#329-unlisted-workspace-block) still prints on the five scanning surfaces that have no error channel — `check` reports the same fact as a located error on stdout, with this prefix and without the location in the text) or a whole file (`error: <path>: <reason>`, [§FS-check.2](FS-check.md#2-outputs)) — or name the file in prose (e.g. `error: read grund.toml: Permission denied (os error 13)`).

#### 2.2.2 Exit codes

`error:` always accompanies a non-zero exit — exit `2` unless a section names
otherwise — for a failure that means the run could not do its job: a
launch-time, setup, or I/O failure that leaves no query context or
trustworthy scan, or an operational command's own failure, such as `fetch`'s
rejected integration output or ambiguous existing content
([§FS-fetch.7](FS-fetch.md#7-output-and-exits)). The named
exception is `grund config validate`, which prints the same located
`error: <path>:<line>: <message>` for an invalid config and exits `1`
([§FS-config.4.1](FS-config.md#41-grund-config-validate-path)). `warning:` leaves the exit code alone — it is a
caution, not a failure.

Once context has selected a project's ID grammar, a resolver-rejected operand
is instead an exit-`1` query failure, alongside `grund id`'s empty-slug /
collision and the other failed ID queries, so it takes the bare shape of
[§FS-errors.2.3](FS-errors.md#23-bare-query-failure) with no `error:` prefix.

#### 2.2.3 Who uses it

Used by [§FS-cli.4](FS-cli.md#4-errors-with-no-source-location) (unknown subcommand / bad flag), [§FS-id.6](FS-id.md#6-exit-codes) (unknown kind, unknown `--format`, scan / I/O error), [§FS-config.4.3](FS-config.md#43-invalid-config-behavior) (config validation), [§FS-check.2.1.1](FS-check.md#211-cli-level-messages) (a malformed config or a per-file read failure mid-scan), [§FS-check.2.2](FS-check.md#22-empty-scan) (the empty-scan `warning:`), [§FS-check.2.2.1](FS-check.md#221-citation-direction-obligation-applies-to-nothing) (the empty citation-obligation `warning:`), and any subcommand reporting a launch-time failure.

#### 2.2.4 Under `--format=json`

A *launch-time* `error:` (bad flag, unreadable config, missing path) is printed as raw text and is never JSON-ified; a *mid-scan* per-file failure collected by `grund check` is one of the report's findings and is rendered in `--format=json` like the others ([§FS-errors.5.2.3](FS-errors.md#523-run-level-findings-in-checks-report)), still on stderr because it is not a finding about the spec graph.

### 2.3 Bare query failure

When a subcommand established its query context but has no result to put on
stdout — an ID query on a missing ID, a missing section, an invalid ID under the
selected grammar, an ambiguous ID or section, or a broken stub; `grund refs` when
the selected resolver rejects an invalid ID or ambiguous number-only
shorthand; `grund id` when the title slugifies to nothing or the proposed ID
collides with an existing declaration:

```
<message>
```

- No prefix at all, on **stderr**, exit `1`. There is no single site to point at and no result to return, so stdout is empty; this line plus the exit code is what tells the caller what happened.
- Distinct from [§FS-errors.2.2](FS-errors.md#22-cli-level-message): there is no `error:` prefix, because this is not a launch/run failure — the command ran fine, the request was just unsatisfiable.

How ambiguity and hint lines read is [§FS-errors.2.3.1](FS-errors.md#231-ambiguity-and-hint-lines); who uses the shape is [§FS-errors.2.3.2](FS-errors.md#232-who-uses-it).

#### 2.3.1 Ambiguity and hint lines

Ambiguity messages list every site in lexicographic `path:line` order ([§FS-show.2.2.1](FS-show.md#221-ambiguous-id)), except an ambiguous number-only shorthand's, which lists its candidate IDs in ID order ([§FS-show.2.2.1.1](FS-show.md#2211-an-ambiguous-shorthand-names-its-candidates)). A `hint:` line may follow on stderr where the next step is obvious ([§FS-errors.1.2](FS-errors.md#12-what-stderr-carries)).

#### 2.3.2 Who uses it

Used by ID queries (missing or invalid ID and missing section — [§FS-show.3](FS-show.md#3-outputs); ambiguous ID — [§FS-show.2.2.1](FS-show.md#221-ambiguous-id); ambiguous section — [§FS-show.2.2.2](FS-show.md#222-ambiguous-section); broken stub — [§FS-show.2.3.4](FS-show.md#234-broken-stub)), by `refs` resolver rejections after its compatibility window ([§FS-refs.4](FS-refs.md#4-exit-codes)), and by `grund id` for a satisfiable query context whose requested allocation has no result (empty slug — [§FS-id.3](FS-id.md#3-slug-derivation); proposed-ID collision — [§FS-id.5](FS-id.md#5-collision-check)). `check` does not use this shape — every line it prints is a located finding (stdout) or a CLI-level message (stderr).

### 2.4 Text success line

A text-mode `grund check` run with zero retained errors and zero retained warnings, and no retained suggestion or unselectable run-level line ([§FS-check.2.1.3](FS-check.md#213-the-success-line)), prints exactly:

```
success
```

One trailing newline follows the line. The line is on **stdout** because it is the command's output ([§FS-errors.1.1](FS-errors.md#11-what-stdout-carries)), exits `0`, and appears only when the selected report is otherwise empty: it says that report is empty, not that the repository has no findings ([§FS-check.2.1.3](FS-check.md#213-the-success-line)). It is not emitted in `--format=json`, where stdout remains findings-only.

## 3. Message text

The shape is structural; the text is human-readable. Style rules apply to every shape:

- **Lowercase first letter.** `unknown reference <ID>` — not `Unknown reference <ID>`.
- **No terminal period.** A single-clause message does not end in `.` or `!`. A run-level caution that runs to more than one clause, such as the empty-scan warning ([§FS-check.2.2.2](FS-check.md#222-the-message-names-the-likely-cause)), is written in sentences and punctuates each, its last included.
- **No ANSI colors yet.** Once colored output lands, the `[output] color` key, whose default is `auto` ([§FS-config.3.6](FS-config.md#36-output--report-format)), may add them ([§GOAL-no-silent-breakage](../goals.md#goal-no-silent-breakage-changes-ship-through-a-deprecation-path) applies); until then plain bytes are the contract.
- **Stable phrasing.** The exact text of each message is part of the user-visible output covered by [§GOAL-no-silent-breakage.1](../goals.md#1-what-counts-as-user-visible): changing it goes through a deprecation path. Tools grep on it. Appending to a message is not changing it: bytes added after text that survives as a verbatim contiguous prefix leave every prefix and `code` consumer reading what it read, so they ship in one release, and only an exact-line consumer is affected — whose migration is the stable `code` of [§FS-errors.3.6](FS-errors.md#36-the-agents-init-messages). [§FS-check.3.24.2](FS-check.md#3242-an-append-not-a-wording-change) is the worked case.
- **Quoted user input** appears in double quotes when the input could be confused with surrounding prose: `"<original title>"`, not `<original title>`.
- **One base for every path in the line** — [§FS-errors.3.1](FS-errors.md#31-one-base-for-every-path-in-the-line).

[§FS-errors.3.2](FS-errors.md#32-the-unknown-project-recovery-shape) to [§FS-errors.3.7](FS-errors.md#37-the-rule-site-unknown-alias-wording-migration) pin particular messages: the unknown-project recovery shape and its wording migration, `check`'s channel prefix, a missing fetch-backed declaration, `agents-init`, and the rule-site unknown alias.

### 3.1 One base for every path in the line

A path written *inside* the message text — a duplicate declaration's other homes, an ambiguous ID's competing sites, the stub a broken-stub refusal names — is a report path like the `<path>` the shape is located at, and is rendered against the same base ([§FS-config.3.6](FS-config.md#36-output--report-format)). In a workspace that base is the root the run reports from, never the member the finding came out of ([§FS-workspace.8.1](FS-workspace.md#81-grund-aliasid)): a line whose two halves are relative to two different roots sends the reader — and an editor following it — to a file that is not there. The path the message quotes back from the user's own text, such as a stub's link target, is not a resolved path and stays verbatim.

### 3.2 The unknown-project recovery shape

The unknown-project recovery shape in [§FS-check.3.8](FS-check.md#38-cross-project-citation-failure) freezes the base `unknown project alias <written>` and, when its first non-empty candidate band supplies alternatives, appends `; did you mean <a>?`, `; did you mean <a> or <b>?`, or `; did you mean <a>, <b> or <c>?`. The base begins lowercase and has no period; the recovery clause has one terminal question mark. Text output carries the whole message, and JSON retains `code: "unknown-project"` while carrying the same bytes in `message` ([§FS-errors.5.1](FS-errors.md#51-on-stdout--the-commands-output)).

### 3.3 The narrowed-run unknown-project wording migration

The narrowed-run scope-only unknown-project message took a three-release wording
migration, which ended in `0.16.0`: its final template is fixed in
[§FS-check.3.8.4](FS-check.md#384-the-scope-only-message-across-three-releases), and the `0.13.2` compatibility suffix — part of the error
message, never a second warning finding — is gone. Exact-line consumers were
asked to migrate during the window to the stable `code == "unknown-project"`;
the code, error severity, sites, selectors, and exit verdict did not change.
Workspace-root candidate messages and bare unknown-project messages were
unchanged throughout.

### 3.4 The `check` channel prefix

For `grund check`, the fixed rule supplies the channel and every located text
line makes it explicit after the location prefix: [§FS-check.3](FS-check.md#3-errors-detected) is `error:`, [§FS-check.4](FS-check.md#4-warnings) is `warning:`, and enabled [§FS-check.2.3](FS-check.md#23-suggestions-channel-opt-in) advisories are `suggestion:`. That structural prefix does not change the finding's message bytes. JSON continues to carry the same distinction in its existing `severity` or `channel` field ([§FS-errors.5.1](FS-errors.md#51-on-stdout--the-commands-output)); `fmt`, `refs`, run-level messages, and LSP retain their existing shapes.

### 3.5 A missing fetch-backed declaration

A missing fetch-backed declaration has two frozen identities, `dangling` /
`error` ([§FS-check.3.1](FS-check.md#31-dangling-citation)) and
`missing-snapshot` / `warning` ([§FS-check.4.12](FS-check.md#412-missing-snapshot)); those sections own the exact
message bytes, the bare-text fetch remedy, and the precedence of an existing
near-ID or illustration hint over the fetch-action tail.

### 3.6 The `agents-init` messages

The five `agents-init` messages took a three-release migration, which ended in
`0.16.0`. In the first two releases each existing message stayed a verbatim
contiguous prefix and gained a fixed tail classifying it as repo maintenance,
saying the citation checks still ran, and naming `0.16.0` as the release its
wording would change in. Exact-line consumers were asked to migrate during that
window to the stable `code == "agents-init"`; code, error severity, and the
default exit verdict did not change. The messages are now the final templates
of [§FS-errors.3.6.1](FS-errors.md#361-the-final-templates).

#### 3.6.1 The final templates

Since `0.16.0`, with the compatibility tail removed, the five templates are:

```text
repo maintenance: malformed grund managed block: <detail> (does not affect citation validity)
repo maintenance: outdated grund init block v<found> — run `grund init` to update to v<current> (does not affect citation validity)
repo maintenance: unsupported grund init block v<found> — this grund supports v<current> (does not affect citation validity)
repo maintenance: stale grund init block: <section> differ from grund.toml — run `grund init` to refresh (does not affect citation validity)
repo maintenance: missing grund init block v<current> — run `grund init` to install it (does not affect citation validity)
```

These are message classifications only: `repo maintenance` is not a finding
category or selector value ([§FS-check.1](FS-check.md#1-inputs)).

### 3.7 The rule-site unknown-alias wording migration

A rule object kind the run holds no workspace vocabulary to resolve is reported
at the rule's own heading as `invalid-rule` ([§FS-rules.4.1](FS-rules.md#41-a-rule-this-scope-cannot-verify)). Until the correcting
release its reason named the kind as the defect — `unknown kind "<KIND>" in
namespace "<ALIAS>"` for a pinned object, `unknown kind "<KIND>" in any
workspace namespace` for `*/<KIND>` — in a scope that cannot know whether that
kind exists anywhere. What such a run actually cannot reach is the workspace.
Those are bytes a consumer may match, so the correction took the three-release
route of [§FS-errors.3.3](FS-errors.md#33-the-narrowed-run-unknown-project-wording-migration) and [§FS-errors.3.6](FS-errors.md#36-the-agents-init-messages) rather than changing outright
([§REQ-backwards-compatibility.1](../requirements/REQ-backwards-compatibility.md#1-what-is-covered), [§REQ-backwards-compatibility.2](../requirements/REQ-backwards-compatibility.md#2-the-deprecation-path)).

Until `0.16.0` each complete legacy reason stayed a verbatim contiguous
prefix and gained the true clause after it, followed by a suffix
naming `0.16.0` as the release its wording would change in. In `0.16.0` the
prefix and the suffix went, and the reason is the true clause alone, in the
shape a narrowed run already uses for a citation it cannot place — say what
cannot be resolved here, offer no candidate, send the reader to the workspace
root ([§FS-check.3.8.3](FS-check.md#383-a-narrowed-run-offers-no-candidate)). Its templates are [§FS-errors.3.7.1](FS-errors.md#371-the-final-templates).

Exact-line consumers were asked to migrate during the window to the stable
`code == "invalid-rule"`; the code, the error severity, the selectors, and the
exit verdict did not change, and `--only invalid-rule` keeps selecting the
finding. An alias the run *can* judge and rejects keeps its legacy reason
unchanged, because there the kind really is what failed.

The reason belongs to the vocabulary check rather than to the finding, so the
same two forms also reach `check --rule`'s pre-scan refusal
([§FS-rules.4](FS-rules.md#4-validation-lifecycle)), where there is no rule heading to report at and therefore no
`code` to migrate to: that surface prints `error: <reason>` on stderr, writes
nothing to stdout, and exits 2. A consumer of it keys on the exit code, which
this migration did not move, and on the sentence it passed in.

#### 3.7.1 The final templates

Since `0.16.0`, with the compatibility prefixes removed, the two reasons are
exactly:

```text
unknown project alias <ALIAS>; no workspace is in scope here, so the alias cannot be resolved — check from the workspace root
no workspace is in scope here, so no namespace can be searched for <KIND> — check from the workspace root
```

## 4. Determinism

Two runs of the same subcommand on the same input must produce byte-identical stdout *and* stderr ([§REQ-deterministic-output](../requirements/REQ-deterministic-output.md#req-deterministic-output-same-input-same-bytes)). This rules out:

- Wall-clock timestamps in messages.
- Process IDs, hostnames, or — in the reports of the tree-reading commands
  [§REQ-deterministic-output](../requirements/REQ-deterministic-output.md#req-deterministic-output-same-input-same-bytes) names — an absolute path or one that escapes the loaded
  root, with no absolute fallback for an in-root target ([§FS-config.3.6](FS-config.md#36-output--report-format),
  [§DF-cli-base-parent-paths.2](../decisions/functional/DF-cli-base-parent-paths.md#2-decision)).
- Non-deterministic ordering — the order each report keeps is [§FS-errors.4.1](FS-errors.md#41-ordering).
- Platform-native path separators in repo-relative output. Any path that appears in a report, JSON field, e2e case manifest, duplicate-site list, stub-link note, or formatter summary is rendered with `/`, so Windows and Unix runs over the same tree compare byte-for-byte.

How `check --only` and `--ignore` keep the contract is [§FS-errors.4.2](FS-errors.md#42-finding-selection).

### 4.1 Ordering

Text `check` findings are grouped as errors,
warnings, then enabled suggestions and sort bytewise by `(path, line,
message)` within each group. JSON `check` findings retain their global
bytewise `(path, line, message)` order across channels. Other reports retain
their existing documented order; multi-site findings are located at the
lexicographically-first site ([§FS-check.2.1](FS-check.md#21-report-format)).

A message that would otherwise be non-deterministic (e.g. the order of duplicate-declaration sites) is sorted before printing.

Rule findings obey this same ordering without a rule-specific sorter. In a
same-anchor `cite each` group, the fixed message puts the target ID immediately
after `<subject> cites ` and before its count, so bytewise message ordering also
orders shared-prefix target IDs bytewise
([§FS-rules.7.6](FS-rules.md#76-selection-json-ordering-and-exits)).

### 4.2 Finding selection

`grund check --only` and `--ignore` preserve [§FS-errors.4](FS-errors.md#4-determinism)'s contract: selection precedes
the format-specific sort and rendering, retained findings keep their
locations, messages, codes, sites, and channels, and reordering or duplicating
selector flags cannot alter the result ([§FS-check.2.1](FS-check.md#21-report-format)).

## 5. JSON format

The subcommands with a machine-readable result or finding surface accept `--format=json`: `check`, `show`, `list`, `refs`, `cover`, `id`, and `integrations` ([§GOAL-friendliness-first.1](../goals.md#1-hard-requirements), [§FS-cli.3](FS-cli.md#3-cross-subcommand-flags), [§FS-integrations.5](FS-integrations.md#5-json-format)). Operational commands whose output is human text or generated files (`fmt`, `fetch`, `init`, `config`, `agent-setup-instructions`, `completions`) do not accept `--format` unless their own spec adds a JSON surface later. JSON follows the same stream split as the text form ([§FS-errors.1](FS-errors.md#1-streams)): what goes to stdout is [§FS-errors.5.1](FS-errors.md#51-on-stdout--the-commands-output), what goes to stderr is [§FS-errors.5.2](FS-errors.md#52-on-stderr--what-is-not-output), and `show --batch` is the query-stream exception of [§FS-errors.5.3](FS-errors.md#53-show---batch).

So `grund check --format=json | jq …`, `grund <ID> --format=json | jq …`, `grund list --format=json | jq …` all work with no stream juggling, and `grund <missing> --format=json | jq …` does not choke because the finding is on stderr where the pipe does not see it.

The text-form messages defined above remain the default. JSON is opt-in.

Value findings are [§FS-errors.5.4](FS-errors.md#54-value-findings); the `code` catalog `check` selects on is [§FS-errors.5.5](FS-errors.md#55-the-check-code-catalog).

### 5.1 On stdout — the command's output

`grund check --format=json` emits its findings as NDJSON, one object per line, in the binding-level shape from [§FS-distribution.3.0](FS-distribution.md#30-language-neutral-data-shapes) (`{ severity, path, line, code, message, sites, authority }`); `severity` carries the `error`/`warning` distinction as a structured field, while text carries the explicit channel prefix after its location prefix ([§FS-errors.3.4](FS-errors.md#34-the-check-channel-prefix)), and `sites` is `null` for an ordinary single-site finding, a `[{ path, line }]` list naming every site for a multi-site finding (a duplicate declaration, [§FS-declarations.checks.duplicate](FS-declarations.md#checksduplicate-duplicate-declaration)). `authority` is the last key and follows `sites` in the same shape: `null` for a finding no chapter rule authored, or a bytewise-sorted list of the rule origins that did ([§FS-rules.7.6](FS-rules.md#76-selection-json-ordering-and-exits)) — `["RULE-security"]` for one declared rule, `["--rule"]` for an ad-hoc trial sentence, `["--rule","RULE-security"]` where both reached the same meaning ([§FS-rules.6](FS-rules.md#6-semantic-deduplication)). It is what lets a caller ask *which rule said this* without matching message text, and it is the field `check --only-rule` queries ([§FS-rules.8](FS-rules.md#8-command-surfaces)). A clean JSON check emits no `success` object. A **suggestion** ([§FS-check.2.3](FS-check.md#23-suggestions-channel-opt-in)), emitted only under `grund check --suggestions`, carries `"channel": "suggestion"` in place of a `severity` — keeping the frozen `{error, warning}` severity set ([§FS-config.6](FS-config.md#6-what-is-not-configured-here)) intact, so a consumer filtering on `severity` never sees one. Query subcommands' results are [§FS-errors.5.1.1](FS-errors.md#511-query-results).

#### 5.1.1 Query results

Query subcommands emit their result on stdout too: one JSON object for a single-result command (`grund <ID> --format=json` — [§FS-show](FS-show.md#fs-show-grund-reads-a-single-declaration-body-by-id); `grund id --format=json` — [§FS-id](FS-id.md#fs-id-grund-proposes-ids-for-new-declarations)), NDJSON — one object per row — for a list command (`grund list` per declaration, `grund refs` per citation, `grund cover` per scanned file).

### 5.2 On stderr — what is not output

A *failed ID query* (`ID not found` / `ambiguous` / `broken stub` / `section not found` / `invalid ID`, exit `1`) emits its one finding object on stderr in the same `{ severity, path, line, code, message, sites, authority }` shape, with `path` and `line` `null` — there is no single site, and there is no result, so nothing goes to stdout. `authority` is present and always `null` there: no query failure is a chapter rule's, and the key set is one set across every record of this shape rather than a conditional a consumer has to branch on. This includes `refs`' invalid-ID and ambiguous-number-only rejections; their codes are respectively `invalid-id` and `ambiguous`, both carry `sites:null`, and neither carries the text-mode hint.

Which ambiguity refusals carry `sites` is [§FS-errors.5.2.1](FS-errors.md#521-sites-on-an-ambiguity-refusal); the messages that stay raw text under any `--format` are [§FS-errors.5.2.2](FS-errors.md#522-launch-time-messages-stay-text); run-level findings in `check`'s report are [§FS-errors.5.2.3](FS-errors.md#523-run-level-findings-in-checks-report).

#### 5.2.1 `sites` on an ambiguity refusal

`sites` carries the `[{ path, line }]` list the message names, the same pairs in the same order, for an `ambiguous` refusal naming an ID with two homes ([§FS-show.2.2.1](FS-show.md#221-ambiguous-id)) and for an `ambiguous-section` refusal ([§FS-show.2.2.2](FS-show.md#222-ambiguous-section)). The number-only shorthand's `ambiguous` refusal names candidate IDs rather than sites ([§FS-show.2.2.1](FS-show.md#221-ambiguous-id)), so — like every other query failure — it carries `sites: null`; a consumer tells the two `ambiguous` shapes apart by whether `sites` is `null`, not by `code`.

#### 5.2.2 Launch-time messages stay text

A *launch-time* CLI-level message ([§FS-errors.2.2](FS-errors.md#22-cli-level-message)) — an error such as a bad flag, unknown kind, unknown project alias, unreadable config or path, or a config the workspace refuses such as [§FS-check.3.30](FS-check.md#330-a-workspace-member-swallows-the-blocks-own-scan)'s (exit `2`), or a warning carried in the run's warning channel, such as [§FS-check.4.10](FS-check.md#410-include_root--false-leaves-the-blocks-own-files-unread)'s and [§FS-workspace.6.1.7.6](FS-workspace.md#6176-how-the-undecidable-claim-warning-travels)'s — stays as its `error:` / `warning:` text line on stderr regardless of `--format`. What decides is which channel carries the fact: a warning settled from the loaded config but carried as one of `check`'s report warnings, such as [§FS-check.4.3](FS-check.md#43-redundant-config-pair)'s and [§FS-check.4.11](FS-check.md#411-config-read-from-the-deprecated-agents-location)'s, is data, and renders as a JSON finding ([§FS-errors.5.2.3](FS-errors.md#523-run-level-findings-in-checks-report)).

#### 5.2.3 Run-level findings in `check`'s report

A run-level finding in `grund check`'s report — about the run, not a finding about the graph, such as the empty-scan `warning:` ([§FS-check.2.2](FS-check.md#22-empty-scan)), the nothing-recognized `warning:` ([§FS-check.4.5](FS-check.md#45-nothing-recognized)), or a per-file read failure collected mid-scan (a `line`-less finding) — is likewise on stderr in both forms; under JSON a run-level warning carries `path`, `line`, `sites`, and `authority` all `null`, any location being in its message text ([§FS-check.4.5](FS-check.md#45-nothing-recognized)). A run-level finding is about the run rather than about a unit, so no rule authored it and `--only-rule` cannot retain it. A scoped run therefore drops it along with everything else no rule authored, exactly as the code axis drops it — `--ignore empty-scan` by name, `--only <any other code>` by omission — and only a mid-scan failure's `io` finding is beyond either axis ([§FS-check.2.1.2](FS-check.md#212-selection-filters-the-complete-report)). Say the consequence plainly, because this is where a scoped trial can still mislead: an author who scopes a sentence over a tree that scanned nothing gets `success` at exit `0`, and the warning that would have said *nothing was scanned, so the sentence never got a chance* is gone with the rest. The `success` there means what it always means — the selected report is empty, not that the repository has no findings ([§FS-check.2.1.3](FS-check.md#213-the-success-line)). The exit code is unmoved either way, these being warnings.

### 5.3 `show --batch`

`show --batch --format=json` is the explicit query-stream exception. Every
well-formed query, including a failed one, produces one ordered stdout envelope
([§FS-output-shapes.4.1](FS-output-shapes.md#41-show---batch---formatjson)); stderr
is reserved for invocation, batch-input, configuration, and scan failures that
abort the run. A batch-input error uses raw
`error: batch input line <N>: <reason>` text because no data-producing phase
began. The entire stream is validated before scanning, so this error leaves
stdout empty and produces no partial records.

### 5.4 Value findings

Value findings use the same object and streams. `invalid-value-declaration`, `invalid-value-binding`, and `value-mismatch` are fixed error codes; a mismatch's `sites` is the sorted declaration-site array, and its `message` is byte-identical to the text message after the primary `path:line:` prefix and its channel prefix ([§FS-errors.2.1](FS-errors.md#21-located-finding), [§FS-values.5](FS-values.md#5-resolution-findings-and-exit-status)). The `invalid-value-binding` that refuses a root-aimed binding for a space carries the offending component's declaration site as its one `sites` entry, the site its text names ([§FS-values.3.1.2](FS-values.md#312-a-binding-aimed-at-the-root)), so text and NDJSON name the same component. Home JSON input that [§FS-values.5.3](FS-values.md#53-incomplete-input-and-deterministic-output) counts as incomplete remains a run-level incomplete-scan failure at exit `2` rather than a semantic value finding.

### 5.5 The `check` code catalog

For `grund check`, `code` is also the exact public selector vocabulary for
[§FS-check.1](FS-check.md#1-inputs). The catalog is sorted by code, and one row is the whole of what the
catalog says about a code: the severity it carries, the release a ramp still
ahead of it changes that severity in, what has to be configured or passed for it
to fire at all, and the specification section that specifies it. Severity lives
here rather than in the section that specifies the check, so promoting a warning
to an error edits this cell and moves no coordinate
([§REQ-spec-section-names.code](../requirements/REQ-spec-section-names.md#code-a-check-is-named-by-its-diagnostic-code)). A code whose row names `—` under *Enabled by* fires on every
run; `Ramp` is `—` where no promotion is promised, a ramp already spent included.

The four `remote-*` rows are specified ahead of the release that introduces them
([§FS-remote-projects](FS-remote-projects.md#fs-remote-projects-a-project-cites-another-repositorys-declarations-from-a-committed-pinned-projection)); until it ships, a config declaring `[workspace.remotes]` is refused
at load ([§FS-remote-projects.declaration.older](FS-remote-projects.md#declarationolder-an-older-grund-refuses-the-table-loudly)), so none of them fires.

The chapter-rule codes `chapter-cardinality`, `citation-cardinality`,
`invalid-rule`, `uncited-unit`, and `unreached-declaration` are selectable on
the same surfaces as every other code
([§FS-rules.7.6](FS-rules.md#76-selection-json-ordering-and-exits)).

Every future check finding code enters this catalog in the release that
introduces it; renaming or removing one requires compatibility treatment. The
catalog changes neither the NDJSON object nor the library/LSP report. `io` is a
recognized code but an incomplete-scan safety finding remains retained and
exit `2` even when `--ignore io` or an excluding `--only` set is present
([§FS-check.2](FS-check.md#2-outputs)).

## 6. The `grund init` transcript

`grund init` ([§FS-init.2.2](FS-init.md#22-stdout--stderr)) writes status lines to **stderr** — `wrote AGENTS.md`, `appended CLAUDE.md`, `exists grund.toml`, etc. — followed by the `next:` block. These are **not** the command's output: `init`'s output is the scaffold it wrote to disk; the transcript is progress, and nobody pipes `grund init`. They use a `<verb> <path>` shape. This is one of two carve-outs from [§FS-errors.1](FS-errors.md#1-streams); the other is `grund integrations --write`, which reports what it wrote on stderr in the same `<verb> <path>` shape ([§FS-integrations.4.1.6](FS-integrations.md#416-outcome-verbs)). Every other subcommand puts its output on stdout. In particular `grund fmt --write` ([§FS-fmt.3](FS-fmt.md#3-outputs)) does **not** use this shape: its `rewrote N line(s):` report is `fmt`'s output and goes to stdout, the same stream as its `--check` dry-run report. A subcommand with no output and no transcript stays silent and lets the exit code carry the verdict.

## 7. What this rules out

- A severity prefix (`error:`, `warning:`) ahead of a located finding's `<path>:<line>:` prefix — that leading position marks a CLI-level message ([§FS-errors.2.2](FS-errors.md#22-cli-level-message)); the channel prefix `check` places goes after the location ([§FS-errors.3.4](FS-errors.md#34-the-check-channel-prefix)).
- Multi-line messages. A finding that wants to elaborate uses `--format=json` and its `code` ([§FS-errors.5.1](FS-errors.md#51-on-stdout--the-commands-output)), not a wrapped paragraph.
- Interactive prompts, progress bars, or spinners. Per [§FS-non-goals.10](FS-non-goals.md#10-interactive-mode), every subcommand is non-interactive.
- Localization. Messages are English; translation is downstream's problem.
