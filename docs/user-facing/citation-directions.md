# Citation directions

`[citations]` describes which kinds of documents cite which other kinds. The
five levels use two rule classes and two enforcement surfaces, as specified by
[the `[citations]` section of grund's config spec](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-config.md#39-citations--citation-direction-rules):

| Level | Rule class | Checked per | Surface |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `must` | obligation | declaration | `grund check` error, and the generated entrypoint |
| `should` | obligation | declaration | `--suggestions` and the generated entrypoint |
| `may` | permission | — | never checked |
| `should-not` | prohibition | citation site | `--suggestions` and the generated entrypoint |
| `must-not` | prohibition | citation site | `grund check` error, and the generated entrypoint |

The grammar is: entries in one array are all required, while `|` inside one
entry means any one of its alternatives. Therefore `must = ["FS|GOAL"]`
requires a citation to either `FS` or `GOAL`, whereas `must = ["FS", "GOAL"]`
requires citations to both. Nearly every real rule is one entry with `|`.

The citing side may be any configured kind, including a non-citable kind, or
the homeless `code` kind. The cited side must be citable, because a citation
needs an ID to point at. A non-citable kind may cite and is labelled by its
home, such as `skills/`; the homeless kind covers any file outside a configured
kind home and renders last.

An obligation on a citable kind that declares no IDs has no unit: no
per-declaration unit fires. If a `must` or `should` obligation is configured,
the kind's folder is walked, and at least one non-entry file is successfully
scanned, `grund check` emits the non-fatal run-level
`empty-citation-obligation` warning ([the check specification says exactly when](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-check.md#221-citation-direction-obligation-applies-to-nothing)).
A directory without declarations is usually `citable = false`, not a citable
kind with an empty rule; make that setting when the directory is a place rather
than an ID namespace. This is the no-unit trap described by
[the non-citable-kinds decision](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/decisions/functional/DF-non-citable-kinds.md#25-obligations-get-a-per-file-unit-and-grounding-follows-the-home).

The config and the generated section below are the same example. The TOML is
shown beside the Markdown it renders:

```toml
[citations]
default = "may"

[citations.FS]
should = ["GOAL|FS"]        # either
must-not = ["AR"]

[citations.DA]
must = ["AR", "FS"]         # both

[citations.skill]           # citable = false: cites, is never cited
must = ["FS"]
must-not = ["AR"]

[citations.code]
should = ["FS|AR"]
```

```markdown
### Citation directions

`must`/`never` are `grund check` errors; `should`/`avoid` are suggestions (`grund check --suggestions`).

- Each **FS** declaration should cite GOAL or FS; never cite AR.
- Each **DA** declaration must cite AR and FS.
- Each file in **skills/** must cite FS; never cite AR.
- Each source file outside the Project map (**code**) that cites anything should cite FS or AR.
Anything not listed above is allowed.
```
