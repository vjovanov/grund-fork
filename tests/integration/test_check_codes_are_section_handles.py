"""§REQ-spec-section-names.code — every check `grund check` enforces is a section
of the concept spec it constrains, named by its diagnostic code verbatim under
that spec's `checks` chapter, and carries a row in the code catalog of
§FS-errors.5.5 that cites the section. This is the requirement's meter
(§AR-goal-measurement.1), and `NOT_YET_MIGRATED` below is the progress bar: the
migration of agent-grounds/grund#260 runs one concept spec at a time, and each
slice strikes its codes off that list as it lands.

The first test landed under `@unittest.expectedFailure`, one commit before the
migration, because the pre-commit hook runs this suite and a plainly failing test
could not be committed without `--no-verify`, which this repository forbids. The
`FS-declarations` slice has landed, so the decorator is gone and the assertion is
plain: it passes on the ten codes of that slice and fails the moment one of them
loses its section or its catalog row."""
