description: Use when bootstrapping or adopting grund in a repository, especially when the user wants an interactive guided setup for grund init, grund.toml, AGENTS.md, docs scaffolding, citation format, scan scope, output format, or Markdown link settings.

# grund init

Guide the user through `grund` adoption. `grund init` itself is non-interactive, so this skill acts as the interactive wrapper: inspect the repository, recommend suitable settings, ask the user to confirm or override every option, write `grund.toml`, run `grund init`, then validate.

## Workflow

1. Inspect the target repo before asking questions. Find existing specs, artifact types, roadmaps, changelogs, decisions, plans, tests, and agent instruction files before recommending anything.
2. Present a short "detected repo shape" summary and recommended setup.
3. If existing specs or spec-like artifacts are present, show the canonical `grund` artifact types beside the detected project-specific sections/tags/document classes, then ask which artifact model to adopt before writing config or refactoring docs.
4. Ask each remaining setup/config question below. For every question, include the recommended value, repo evidence, pros, cons, and when to choose something else.
5. Write `grund.toml` from the analysis before running `grund init`, so generated guidance reflects the repository's actual grammar, marker, strict mode, kinds, artifact folders, and scan scope.
6. Run `grund init [path] [--name NAME] [--force]`, adding `--docs` only when the repo is fresh or the user selected a canonical-layout migration that needs the scaffold. Omit `--name` to reuse a target config's `project_name`, falling back to the target directory name when the config has none; pass it only to override that generated identity for this run. Preview the run with `--dry-run` if the user wants to inspect what will change before committing, and offer `--check` — the same preview, writing nothing and exiting `1` when a file is still pending — as the pre-commit or CI gate that catches a managed block whose text drifted while its version heading stayed current. `init` refuses a target that no `.git`, `.hg`, `.jj`, or `.svn` marker covers, in it or any ancestor: for a directory not yet under version control, either run the VCS's own init first or pass `--no-vcs`. It also refuses the home directory and the machine-global agent instruction files (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, and the rest of that set) with no flag at all — those say the path is wrong, not that an option is missing, so re-point the run rather than trying to force it.
7. Run `grund config validate [path]` and `grund check [path]`.
8. Summarize generated files, validation results, existing specs/artifacts found, and any follow-up cleanup.
9. Optionally offer to wire the user's editor to the `grund-lsp` server (see Editor Setup). Editor configuration is the user's one-time work, not something `grund init` writes — so only offer it, and prefer editor **user** settings over a per-repo config so the server works in every project.

## Repo Analysis First

Use `rg` and `rg --files` first. Prefer evidence from existing files over generic defaults.

Analyze:

- Existing `AGENTS.md`, a `grund.toml` in either discovery location (root or `.agents/`), and grund-style citations.
- Documentation layout: `docs/`, `e2e/`, `spec/`, `rfcs/`, `adr/`, `decisions/`, `roadmap`, `changelog`.
- Existing artifact types and their homes: specifications, requirements, RFCs, ADRs/decisions, roadmaps, changelogs, plans, end-to-end fixtures, examples, package READMEs, generated reports, and runtime logs. Use these to choose `[[kinds]]`, `[scan].include`, and `[scan].exclude`; do not add generic folders when the repo already has project-specific artifact homes.
- Source layout: `src/`, `lib/`, `crates/`, `packages/`, `apps/`, `services/`, `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `test/`, `tests/`.
- Languages from file extensions and manifests such as `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `.csproj`, `Package.swift`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, `build.sbt`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `dbt_project.yml`.
- Ignore/build/vendor directories from `.gitignore` and common generated paths.
- Existing ID/citation patterns, including headings and tokens that look like `FS-001-login`, `FS-login`, `ADR-001`, `RFC-42`, or `§FS-...`.
- Existing rendered-doc target: GitHub default, GitLab, MkDocs, Pandoc, or unknown.
- Whether this is a fresh repo, a docs-heavy repo, or an existing codebase adopting grund.

## Asking Style

Do not ask as a blank preference survey. Ask the user to confirm or change a recommendation.

Each prompt must include:

- Recommended value.
- Evidence from repo analysis.
- Pros.
- Cons.
- When to choose a different value.

The user should be able to accept the full recommendation set quickly, but still see and override every option.

## Init Questions

Ask first:

- Target path: default `.`
- Project name: default target config value, then target directory basename
- Artifact model when existing specs are detected: canonical `grund`, canonical core plus project-specific extras, or existing structure with citations
- Scaffold docs/e2e with `--docs`: default no for existing repos, yes for fresh repos
- Existing file behavior: append/update default, or `--force`

## Existing Specs Adoption

When the repo already contains specs, requirements, ADRs, RFCs, design docs, plans, tests, or other spec-like artifacts, do not silently scaffold over them or refactor them into canonical `grund` folders. First show the user:

- The canonical `grund` artifact types:
  - `GRUND` — reason / grounding doc
  - `GOAL` — project goals
  - `FS` — functional specs
  - `AR` — architecture specs
  - `DF` — functional decisions
  - `DA` — architectural decisions
  - `E2E` — executable scenarios
  - `RM` — roadmap
- The detected project-specific sections, tags, or document classes, such as `ADR`, `RFC`, `REQ`, `SPEC`, `DESIGN`, `PLAN`, `RUNBOOK`, or whatever the repo already uses.

Then ask the user to choose one adoption model:

| Option | When to recommend it | What the agent does |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical `grund` | Fresh or lightly documented repos, or users who explicitly want to reorganize around `grund` conventions. | Use `GRUND`, `GOAL`, `FS`, `AR`, `DF`, `DA`, `E2E`, and `RM` as the complete artifact model; add or refactor docs toward canonical homes only after user confirmation. |
| Canonical core plus project-specific extras | Repos with useful existing ADRs/RFCs/requirements but no clear behavior-vs-architecture backbone. | Use `GRUND`, `GOAL`, `FS`, and `AR` as the grounding backbone, then add custom `[[kinds]]` for project-specific artifacts. |
| Existing structure with citations | Mature repos with a strong existing taxonomy or high migration cost. | Preserve current sections/tags/document classes, configure `[[kinds]]` and `[scan]` around them, and add `grund` citations/declarations without forcing canonical folders. |

The question should include a recommendation grounded in the inventory. Do not write `grund.toml`, run `grund init --docs`, move documents, rename headings, or add bulk citations until the user chooses the adoption model. Once selected, use the model to decide whether the setup is only config plus entrypoint refresh, or a broader docs refactor with a visible plan.

## Config Questions

Ask these in order.

### Top-level

`grund_config_version = 1`

Do not ask unless the user is migrating schemas. Keep `1`.

`project_name`

Pros of explicit name: stable display name for agents/tools.
Cons: one more metadata value to maintain if repo is renamed.
Default: the target config's existing value, otherwise the target directory name.

### `[reference]`

`marker`

Default: `§`.
Pros: visually distinct, avoids false positives.
Cons: awkward to type without trigger/editor help.
Alternatives: `@`, `#`, or `ref:` only if the team has strong conventions.

`trigger`

Default: `$$`.
Pros: easy typing path to `§`.
Cons: may conflict with math-heavy Markdown or template languages.
Recommend changing only if `$$` is common in the repo.

`strict`

Default: `false`.
Pros false: easier adoption; bare `FS-001-login` references work.
Cons false: more accidental matches.
Pros true: citations are intentional and explicit.
Cons true: migration requires adding markers everywhere.
Recommend false for new/easy adoption, true for mature repos.

`require_grounding`

Default: `false`.
Pros true: every scanned source file must cite or declare a grounding ID.
Cons true: high adoption cost and noisy until coverage discipline exists.
Recommend false initially; enable later or in CI once coverage is deliberate.

### `[id]`

`format`

Default: `{kind}-{number}-{slug}`.

```
       ┌──────────── citation ──────────┐
           ┌────────── ID ──────────┐
  [§] KIND - [number -] slug [.section]
   │   │       │         │       │
   │   │       │         │       └─ optional dotted path, arbitrary depth (.3, .3.1, .3.1.5, …)
   │   │       │         └───────── [a-z][a-z0-9-]*
   │   │       └─────────────────── optional ordinal (e.g. 001)
   │   └─────────────────────────── G│FS│AR│DA│DF│E2E│RM│DISC
   └─────────────────────────────── citation marker (writing only)
```

Pick one per repo and keep it stable — mixing is unsupported because citations would look identical but resolve under different rules.

| Scheme                                     | Example             | Benefit                                                                                                          | Trade-off                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{kind}-{number}-{slug}` *(default)*       | `FS-014-user-login` | Number is the stable identifier; slug is descriptive and can be **renamed freely** without breaking citations.   | Two tokens to type; needs `grund id` to allocate the next number.        |
| `{kind}-{number}` (RFC-style)              | `FS-014`            | Maximally stable — no slug to drift. Familiar from RFCs/PEPs/JEPs/ADRs.                                          | Opaque at the call site: `§FS-014` tells you nothing without resolving it. |
| `{kind}-{slug}` *(`grund` itself uses this)* | `FS-user-login`     | Self-describing — reads like English in prose and code. No number to allocate.                                   | Renaming a slug rewrites every citation. Slug must be unique per kind.   |

Rule of thumb: pick `{kind}-{slug}` until rename churn or ID count starts to hurt; switch to `{kind}-{number}-{slug}` when it does.

If existing IDs are detected, prefer matching them over the canonical default.

`section_separator`

Default: `.`.
Pros: natural `FS-login.3.1` syntax.
Cons: can collide with custom ID formats or slug rules.
Change only for existing conventions, e.g. `#` or `:`.

`number_pattern`

Default: `\d+`.
Pros: simple numbered IDs.
Cons: does not enforce fixed width like `001`.
Use `\d{3}` only if the team wants strict padded numbers.

`slug_pattern`

Default: `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*`.
Pros: URL-friendly, portable, predictable.
Cons: excludes uppercase and underscores.
Relax only to match existing IDs.

### `[[kinds]]`

Default kinds: `GRUND`, `GOAL`, `FS`, `AR`, `DF`, `DA`, `E2E`, `RM`.

Ask whether to keep defaults, remove unused kinds, or add project-specific kinds.

Pros of defaults: matches grund docs and generated scaffold.
Cons: some repos may not need all categories.
Pros of custom kinds: adapts to existing taxonomy.
Cons: replacing defaults means the full list must be copied; no merge.

For each kind ask: `kind`, `folder`, `title`.

A directory that holds agent-facing content rather than declarations — skills,
runbooks, a prompt library, a test suite — is a kind with `citable = false`: it
gets a home, a title and citation rules, and declares no IDs. Ask for one
wherever the repo has such a directory and the answer to "should an agent be
told this exists?" is yes.

### `[scan]`

`include`

Default: `["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "src"]`.
Pros: focused, avoids scanning root clutter.
Cons: misses specs/citations outside these dirs.
Every configured `[[kinds]]` home is walked whether or not it is listed here, so
this key names the *extra* roots. Base the recommendation on actual directories.
Do not include paths that do not exist unless `--docs` will create them.

`exclude`

Default: `["target", "node_modules", ".git", "dist", "build", ".venv"]`.
Pros: skips generated/vendor-heavy trees.
Cons: can hide intentional generated docs if stored there.
Usually keep defaults and add repo-specific build/cache dirs.

`extensions`

Default includes common Markdown and source extensions.
Pros: polyglot coverage.
Cons: scanning more extensions costs time and may surface noise.
Recommend only extensions found in the repo plus Markdown, unless the repo is fresh.

`comment_prefixes`

Default: `["//", "#", ";", "--", "*", "/*"]`.
Pros: broad language support.
Cons: may match prose-like comments in some languages.
Usually keep defaults, or narrow to the detected language set for established repos.

`docstring_python`

Default: `true`.
Pros: Python docstrings can carry inline declarations/citations.
Cons: docstring scanning can surface intentional prose examples.
Recommend true if Python files exist.

`respect_gitignore`

Default: `true`.
Pros: avoids ignored/generated/vendor files.
Cons: ignored files with real specs will not be scanned.
Keep true unless the repo intentionally stores tracked specs in ignored paths.

### `[output]`

`format`

Default: `text`.
Pros text: readable locally and in CI logs.
Cons text: harder for tools to consume.
Use `json` for automation dashboards or custom CI parsing.

`color`

Default: `auto`.
Pros: readable terminal output without polluting non-TTY logs.
Cons: not fully meaningful until colored output lands.
Keep `auto`.

`relative_paths`

Default: `true`.
Pros: deterministic, repo-root-relative reports.
Cons: less convenient when running from a subdirectory and expecting local paths.
Keep true for CI and shared logs.

### `[fmt.cross_refs]`

`enabled`

Default: `true`.
Pros true: Markdown citations can become normal links for rendered docs.
Cons true: extra churn and renderer-specific anchors.
Recommend true unless the repo intentionally keeps citations unwrapped in Markdown; set false to opt out.

`anchor_format`

Default: `github`.
Options: `github`, `gitlab`, `mkdocs`, `pandoc`, `none`.

Pros of matching renderer: links work in published docs.
Cons: wrong profile creates broken anchors.
Use `none` if only file links are desired.

### `[citations]`

<!-- BEGIN citation-directions -->
# Citation directions

`[citations]` describes which kinds of documents cite which other kinds. The
five levels use two rule classes and two enforcement surfaces, as specified by
[the `[citations]` section of grund's config spec](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-config.md#39-citations--citation-direction-rules):

| Level | Rule class | Checked per | Surface |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `must` | obligation | declaration | `grund check` error, and the generated entrypoint |
| `should` | obligation | declaration | `--suggestions` and the generated entrypoint |
| `may` | permission | — | never checked |
| `should-not` | prohibition | citation site | `--suggestions` and the generated entrypoint |
| `must-not` | prohibition | citation site | `grund check` error, and the generated entrypoint |

The grammar is: entries in one array are all required, while `|` inside one
entry means any one of its alternatives. Therefore `must = ["FS|GOAL"]`
requires a citation to either `FS` or `GOAL`, whereas `must = ["FS", "GOAL"]`
requires citations to both. Nearly every real rule is one entry with `|`.

The citing side may be any configured kind, including a non-citable kind, or
the homeless `code` kind. The cited side must be citable, because a citation
needs an ID to point at. A non-citable kind may cite and is labelled by its
home, such as `skills/`; the homeless kind covers any file outside a configured
kind home and renders last.

An obligation on a citable kind that declares no IDs has no unit: no
per-declaration unit fires. If a `must` or `should` obligation is configured,
the kind's folder is walked, and at least one non-entry file is successfully
scanned, `grund check` emits the non-fatal run-level
`empty-citation-obligation` warning ([the check specification says exactly when](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-check.md#221-citation-direction-obligation-applies-to-nothing)).
A directory without declarations is usually `citable = false`, not a citable
kind with an empty rule; make that setting when the directory is a place rather
than an ID namespace. This is the no-unit trap described by
[the non-citable-kinds decision](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/decisions/functional/DF-non-citable-kinds.md#25-obligations-get-a-per-file-unit-and-grounding-follows-the-home).

The config and the generated section below are the same example. The TOML is
shown beside the Markdown it renders:

```toml
[citations]
default = "may"

[citations.FS]
should = ["GOAL|FS"]        # either
must-not = ["AR"]

[citations.DA]
must = ["AR", "FS"]         # both

[citations.skill]           # citable = false: cites, is never cited
must = ["FS"]
must-not = ["AR"]

[citations.code]
should = ["FS|AR"]
```

```markdown
### Citation directions

`must`/`never` are `grund check` errors; `should`/`avoid` are suggestions (`grund check --suggestions`).

- Each **FS** declaration should cite GOAL or FS; never cite AR.
- Each **DA** declaration must cite AR and FS.
- Each file in **skills/** must cite FS; never cite AR.
- Each source file outside the Project map (**code**) that cites anything should cite FS or AR.
Anything not listed above is allowed.
```
<!-- END citation-directions -->

Source: [grund's canonical citation-directions page](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/user-facing/citation-directions.md); the
marked region above is kept byte-identical to it by the asset-sync test.

Pros: one complete explanation teaches the grammar before a user edits rules,
and the checked copy keeps repository and installed setup surfaces aligned.

Cons: the explanation adds setup text for repositories that never enable
`[citations]`.

Recommend starting with the canonical climbing ruleset from the template
comment at `should`, then promoting each kind's rule to `must` or `must-not`
once the repository passes it. Choose a different set only when the repo's
artifact dependencies genuinely differ; keep one array entry per required
target and use `|` for alternatives.

## Recommendation Heuristics

### `--docs`

Recommend `--docs = true` when the repo has little or no `docs/` or `e2e/` structure.

Recommend `--docs = false` when the repo already has meaningful docs or tests, and suggest adding only missing grund files.

### `[reference].strict`

Recommend the default `strict = true` for first adoption, especially when the repo has noisy ID-like tokens or wants deliberate citation hygiene.

Recommend `strict = false` only when the repo already relies on bare citations and needs a compatibility window before running `grund fmt --marker`.

### `[reference].require_grounding`

Recommend `false` for initial adoption.

Recommend `true` only when the repo already has broad spec-to-code citation coverage or the user explicitly wants a strict co-change discipline.

### `[id].format`

Recommend `{kind}-{number}-{slug}` for fresh repos and teams that want stable IDs with readable names.

Recommend `{kind}-{number}` when existing docs already use ADR/RFC-style numbered IDs.

Recommend `{kind}-{slug}` when existing docs are title/slug based and stable numeric allocation would feel artificial.

### `[[kinds]]`

Start from the default kinds.

Recommend adding custom kinds when the repo already has clear categories such as `ADR`, `RFC`, `REQ`, `API`, `SEC`, or `OPS`.

Recommend removing defaults only when they would clearly confuse the project.

### `[scan].include`

Base this on actual directories:

- Rust workspace: include `["docs", "e2e", "src", "crates", "tests"]` when present.
- JS monorepo: include `["docs", "e2e", "src", "packages", "apps", "tests"]` when present.
- Go repo: include `["docs", "e2e", "cmd", "internal", "pkg", "tests"]` when present.

### `[fmt.cross_refs].anchor_format`

Recommend:

- `github` when the repo is hosted on GitHub or no renderer is evident.
- `gitlab` for GitLab repos.
- `mkdocs` when `mkdocs.yml` exists.
- `pandoc` when Pandoc config/build scripts are evident.
- `none` when Markdown links should only point to files without section anchors.

## Language And Repo Shape Examples

Use these examples to turn repo evidence into recommended `[scan]` settings. Include only directories that exist, unless `--docs` will create them.

### Rust

Evidence: `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `crates/`, `src/**/*.rs`.

```toml
[scan]
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "src", "crates", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "rs"]
exclude = ["target", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["//", "/*", "*"]
```

Pros: covers workspace crates, integration tests, and Rust doc comments.
Cons: may miss generated docs outside `docs/`.

### TypeScript / JavaScript

Evidence: `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, `apps/`, `packages/`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "src", "apps", "packages", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx"]
exclude = ["node_modules", "dist", "build", "coverage", ".next", ".turbo", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["//", "/*", "*"]
```

Pros: works for frontend apps and monorepos.
Cons: broad monorepos may need narrower package selection.

### Python

Evidence: `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`, `src/`, package dirs, `tests/`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "src", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "py"]
exclude = [".venv", "__pycache__", ".pytest_cache", ".mypy_cache", "build", "dist", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["#"]
docstring_python = true
```

Pros: supports citations in comments and docstrings.
Cons: docstring scanning can surface intentional prose examples.

### Go

Evidence: `go.mod`, `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `*.go`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "cmd", "internal", "pkg", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "go"]
exclude = ["vendor", "dist", "build", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["//", "/*", "*"]
```

Pros: matches common Go project layout.
Cons: single-package repos may only need `["docs", "src"]` or `["docs", "."]` if code is at root.

### Java / Kotlin / Gradle

Evidence: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`, `src/main`, `src/test`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "src"]
extensions = ["md", "java", "kt"]
exclude = ["target", "build", ".gradle", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["//", "/*", "*"]
```

Pros: covers Maven and Gradle conventions.
Cons: multi-module builds may need module directories added explicitly.

### C / C++

Evidence: `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `src/`, `include/`, `lib/`, `tests/`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "src", "include", "lib", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "c", "cpp", "h", "hpp"]
exclude = ["build", "dist", "out", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["//", "/*", "*"]
```

Pros: covers implementation and public headers.
Cons: vendored headers should be excluded if present.

### C# / .NET

Evidence: `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `src/`, `test/`, `tests/`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "src", "test", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "cs"]
exclude = ["bin", "obj", "TestResults", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["//", "/*", "*"]
```

Pros: covers normal solution layout.
Cons: generated code folders may need extra excludes.

More repository-shape examples for Ruby/Rails, PHP, Swift, and Scala live in
the [supplementary init examples](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/user-facing/init-repo-shapes.md).

### SQL / Data Projects

Evidence: `db/`, `migrations/`, `models/`, `*.sql`, `dbt_project.yml`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "db", "migrations", "models", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "sql", "py", "yml", "yaml"]
exclude = ["target", "logs", ".venv", ".git"]
comment_prefixes = ["--", "#"]
```

Pros: covers dbt and migration-heavy repos.
Cons: YAML comments are line-only; generated dbt target dirs must stay excluded.

### Polyglot Monorepo

Evidence: multiple manifests and top-level `apps/`, `packages/`, `services/`, `libs/`, `tools/`.

```toml
include = ["requirements.md", "docs", "e2e", "apps", "packages", "services", "libs", "tools", "tests"]
extensions = ["md", "rs", "go", "java", "kt", "ts", "tsx", "js", "py", "c", "cpp", "cs", "rb", "php"]
exclude = ["target", "node_modules", ".git", "dist", "build", ".venv", "coverage", ".next", ".turbo"]
comment_prefixes = ["//", "#", ";", "--", "*", "/*"]
docstring_python = true
```

Pros: broad coverage for adoption across teams.
Cons: can be noisy; recommend narrowing after the first `grund check`, then `grund check --full .` to see what the narrowing left out.

When multiple language examples apply, merge them conservatively: union the real include dirs, union the extensions actually present, and union generated/cache excludes. Prefer a narrower first config that passes cleanly over an over-broad config that floods the user with findings — and then run `grund check --full .`, which reports the citations that resolve to nothing in the directories `include` left out. A narrow `include` is a good starting point precisely because that check exists; without it, the citations the first config forgot are invisible rather than merely unchecked ([the full-tree scope](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-check.md#13-the-full-tree-scope---full)).

## Validation

After writing config, run:

```bash
grund config validate .
grund init .
grund check .
grund check --full .
```

The last line checks the config itself: `grund check .` reads only what `[scan] include` names, so `grund check --full .` walks the whole root past that key and reports the references resolving to nothing out there ([the full-tree scope](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-check.md#13-the-full-tree-scope---full)) — each one names a directory that belongs in `include`. The wider walk stops only at *declared* workspace members, not at any nested `grund.toml`, so a vendored or example project inside the tree is read under this project's grammar; list it in `[scan] exclude`, or in `[workspace] members` if it is one of ours.

If custom config affects `AGENTS.md`, ensure `grund.toml` exists before `grund init` so the generated managed block reflects the selected ID grammar, marker, strict mode, kinds, and existing artifact layout.

## Querying the Structure

Once the tree checks clean, read its structure with grund's queries rather than by parsing heading lines: `grund list --selector` takes a rule subject as a query, and its `{id, section}` rows are the input `grund show --batch` expands. Each answer's `.result.sections[]` lists the unit's subpoints as `path`, `title` and `depth`:

```bash
grund list --selector "The requirements chapter of each FS" --format json | jq -c '{id,section}' | grund show --batch --toc --format json
```

The [Querying grund guide](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/user-facing/querying.md) has the rest: bodies in bulk with `show --batch --brief|--full` or `--all`, `refs --descendants`, and the whole citation graph from `cover --format json`.

## Editor Setup

Optional, and only if the user wants editor integration (diagnostics, hover previews, go-to-definition, references, and the live `$$` → `§` transform). `grund init` does not write editor config; wiring an editor to `grund-lsp` is the user's one-time work.

- Confirm the CLI and server are installed: `grund --version` and `grund-lsp --version` (`cargo install grund-lsp` if missing).
- Point the editor's LSP client at `grund-lsp` for Markdown plus the languages in `[scan].extensions`. Full per-editor snippets are in the [user-facing LSP setup guide](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/user-facing/lsp.md).
- **Recommend placing the client config in the editor's user (global) settings, not a per-repo file.** A per-repo config (e.g. VSCode/VSCodium `.vscode/settings.json`) means the server silently does nothing in any repo that lacks it — the editor falls back to its built-in behavior, so citations underline only a single hyphen-delimited word and references miss most sites. User settings configure `grund-lsp` once for every project. Use a per-repo file only for a deliberate project-specific override.

## Clickable Citation Integrations

Optional, and only if the user wants a plain `§<ID>` citation to be clickable in their terminal or editor (`grund integrations`, [the integrations reference](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-integrations.md#fs-integrations-grund-prints-and-installs-its-rendering-layer-integrations)). These are one-time, user-side, and env-specific, so propose rather than apply silently:

- Detect what applies: `grund integrations --format json` names the terminal/editor found in the environment and, for each, the exact `--write` command.
- Show the user the change before touching disk: `grund integrations <client>` prints the config snippet and the `grund-open` resolver (or, for `vscode`, the unpacked extension) so they can read it first.
- Install only on confirmation: `grund integrations <client> --write` installs the client integration, records the user-local conversation preference, and synchronizes managed blocks into the global instruction files of the six file-backed agents (Codex, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Zed, Pi — [user preference and global agent instructions](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-integrations.md#43-user-preference-and-global-agent-instructions)). It is idempotent; never write without the user's go-ahead.
- The installed default asks agents for plain local citations. Use `grund integrations --write --conversation link` as a preference-only user override when the TUI has no rendering support; no arbitrary client is installed. The editor choice (`GRUND_OPEN_CMD` or `EDITOR`) never belongs in shared repository text.
- One opinion *is* committable: a repository may set `[reference] conversation = "link"` in `grund.toml` ([the repository-opinion decision](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/decisions/functional/DF-repo-conversation-opinion.md#df-repo-conversation-opinion-repositories-may-commit-a-link-only-conversation-rendering-opinion)), and the generated entrypoint then teaches linked local citations to every cloner with zero per-user setup. The form follows the per-agent gate ([gated per agent, with `path` as the fallback](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/decisions/functional/DF-conversation-link-target.md#24-the-form-is-gated-per-agent-and-the-fallback-is-path)): `CLAUDE.md` teaches a Markdown link whose visible text is the citation and whose target is `file://<absolute path>#L<line>`, while `AGENTS.md` — the file Codex reads, where that form erases the citation — keeps the location as plain `path:line` text. A `CLAUDE.md` symlinked to `AGENTS.md` is one file and keeps the plain form; `grund init --claude` writes a real Claude entrypoint (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`, the path the symlink has not taken) instead. It is the fallback for machines that never stated a preference (fresh clones, cloud sessions, Cursor and Windsurf, whose only grund channel is the committed entrypoint); a machine whose recorded preference is `plain` keeps bare citations there, because its rendering layer already resolves them. Without the key, repository instructions carry only the fixed repository-web rule. Offer it when a team wants clickable conversation citations without asking each member to run `grund integrations`.

### Chapter rules

Write one controlled-English sentence as a rule declaration title and put the
reason in its non-empty body. Kind names and fixed words are case-sensitive;
every sentence ends in one `.`. `must` and `must not` produce errors. `should`
and `should not` produce suggestions, visible with `grund check --suggestions`
and never changing the exit status.

Subjects select local units only:

- `Each FS` selects every FS declaration.
- `FS-login` selects one declaration.
- `The requirements chapter of each FS` selects that named chapter in every FS.
- `FS-login.requirements` selects one exact named chapter.

Named chapter subjects select handles: `The goal chapter of each FS` reaches `## goal: Goal and hypothesis` by `goal` ([chapter subjects](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-rules.md#2-subject-selectors)). Presence rules compare direct chapter display names case-insensitively: `Each FS must have exactly one goal chapter.` counts zero for that heading and one for `## goal: Goal` ([presence matching](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-rules.md#31-chapter-presence)). The finding appends the expected display name and observed pairs such as `"goal: Goal and hypothesis"`, or `none` ([comparison context](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-rules.md#721-display-name-comparison-context)). Presence `NAME` must be one non-empty token: `Goal and hypothesis` is refused with `NAME forbids whitespace anywhere.` appended to the existing guidance; authored display titles may still contain spaces ([whitespace refusal](https://github.com/agent-grounds/grund/blob/main/docs/functional-spec/FS-rules.md#351-presence-name-whitespace-refusal)).

Named-chapter subjects require `[id] named_sections = true`. Phase 1 has no
paths, files, folders, wildcards, subject namespaces, numbered-chapter subjects,
exceptions, definitions, derived terms, settings, or source-code symbols.

<!-- BEGIN chapter-rules-emptiness -->
A quantified chapter subject selects only the chapters that exist, and a
declaration of the kind that has none is reported rather than passed over, so a
chapter-scoped citation rule reaches every declaration of its kind.

`The requirements chapter of each FS must cite at least one REQ.` reports an FS
whose `requirements` chapter cites no REQ, and reports an FS with no
`requirements` chapter at all — the edit the rule could not see before:

```text
docs/fs/FS-login.md:1: error: FS-login has no requirements chapter, so RULE-requirements cannot reach it; add the chapter, or narrow the rule to the declarations that have one; this became an error in grund 0.16.0
```

Add the chapter or narrow the rule: those two are the whole answer. The error
fails the run like every other `must` finding; `--ignore unreached-declaration`
is the opt-out for a repository that wants the absence reported by nothing, and
a `should` rule reports it as a suggestion that never moves the exit status.

A chapter-presence rule beside the citation rule is not a third answer — it
raises its own `chapter-cardinality` and suppresses nothing, so one absent
chapter under both prints both lines. Write the two sentences together to state
the count as well as the citation:

```text
Each FS must have at least one requirements chapter.
The requirements chapter of each FS must cite at least one REQ.
```

The exact spelling reports the same absence as a different kind of finding.
`FS-login.requirements must cite at least one REQ.` names one unit, so deleting
that chapter makes the rule itself an `invalid-rule` finding — `literal subject
FS-login.requirements does not resolve` — located where the sentence is written
rather than at the declaration. Where both spellings stand over the same absent
chapter, both fire.

`grund list --selector FS.requirements` prints one row per declaration that has
the chapter, so the declarations it omits are the ones the rule now reports. A
subject that selects nothing at all prints nothing and exits 0.

The complete accepted sentence forms, with representative findings, are:

- `Each FS must have at least one requirements chapter.` → `chapter-cardinality`.
- `Each FS must have at least 2 requirements chapters.` → `chapter-cardinality`.
- `FS-login should have at most 2 goals chapters.` → suggestion `chapter-cardinality`.
- `Each FS must have exactly one requirements chapter.` → `chapter-cardinality`.
- `Each FS should have exactly 2 review chapters.` → suggestion `chapter-cardinality`.
- `Each FS must cite at least one GOAL or REQ.` → zero matches reuse `missing-citation`.
- `The requirements chapter of each FS must cite at least one REQ.` → zero matches reuse `missing-citation`; a declaration with no such chapter, `unreached-declaration`.
- `Each FS should cite at least one GOAL.` → suggestion `suggested-citation`.
- `Each FS must cite at least 2 REQ.` → `citation-cardinality`, including at zero, because the floor is above one.
- `FS-login.requirements should cite at most 2 REQ.` → suggestion `citation-cardinality`.
- `FS-login.requirements must cite exactly one REQ.` → `citation-cardinality`.
- `AR-overview.system-overview must cite each AR at least once.` → one `citation-cardinality` per missed AR.
- `AR-overview.system-overview must cite each AR at least 2 times.` → one `citation-cardinality` per short-counted AR.
- `AR-overview.system-overview should cite each AR at most 2 times.` → suggestion `citation-cardinality`.
- `AR-overview.system-overview must cite each AR exactly once.` → one `citation-cardinality` per off-count AR.
- `AR-overview.system-overview should cite each AR exactly 2 times.` → suggestion `citation-cardinality`.
- `Each FS must be cited by at least one AR.` → `uncited-unit`.
- `Each FS must be cited by at least 2 AR.` → `uncited-unit`.
- `FS-login.requirements should be cited by at most 2 AR or GOAL.` → suggestion `uncited-unit`.
- `Each FS must be cited by exactly one AR.` → `uncited-unit`.
- `Each FS must not cite any AR.` → one site-anchored `forbidden-citation` per citation.
- `FS-login.requirements should not cite any AR or GOAL.` → one site-anchored `discouraged-citation` suggestion per citation.

Counts are positive decimal integers. Spell one as `one` where shown; numeric
counts other than one use plural `chapters` or `times`. Object kinds may be local
(`REQ`), pinned to a workspace member (`api/REQ`), or any member (`*/REQ`), and
`or` forms one normalized target set. A namespaced object kind needs the workspace
in scope: a run without one says so at the rule's heading and still writes the block.

Common refusals are intentional. Each names what failed and offers your sentence with only the refused part replaced, which is accepted when you paste it back; where grund cannot know what belongs in its place, it offers nothing, and `grund check --rule` lists the known kinds when what is missing is a kind:

- `Each FS may not cite any AR.` → `modality "may not" is not accepted; accepted form: Each FS must not cite any AR.`
- `Each FS must cite no AR.` → `"cite no" is not accepted; accepted form: Each FS must not cite any AR.`
- `Each FS must cite a GOAL.` → `quantifier "a" is ambiguous; accepted forms: "Each FS must cite at least one GOAL." or "Each FS must cite exactly one GOAL."`
- `Each FS must cite at least 1 GOAL.` → `numeric "at least 1" is not canonical; accepted form: Each FS must cite at least one GOAL.`
- `Each FS must cite exactly 1 GOAL.` → `numeric "exactly 1" is not canonical; accepted form: Each FS must cite exactly one GOAL.`
- `Each FS must cite at least one GOAL and must not cite any AR.` → `conjunctions are not accepted; accepted forms: "Each FS must cite at least one GOAL." and "Each FS must not cite any AR."`
- `Each FS must have exactly one  chapter.` → `chapter name must be a non-empty NAME with no surrounding whitespace; NAME forbids whitespace anywhere.`
- `Each FS must cite at least one GOAL` → `rule must end with "."; accepted form: Each FS must cite at least one GOAL.`
- `each FS must cite at least one GOAL.` → `fixed word "Each" is case-sensitive; accepted form: Each FS must cite at least one GOAL.`
- `Each file in vendor/ must cite at least one FS.` → `path subjects are not accepted in phase 1`, then `known kinds: GOAL, REQ, FS, AR, RULE`
- `Each */FS must cite at least one GOAL.` → `subject namespaces must be local in phase 1; accepted form: Each FS must cite at least one GOAL.`
- `FS-login.* must cite at least one REQ.` → `section-component wildcards are not accepted in phase 1; accepted form: FS-login must cite at least one REQ.`
- `Each chapter of each FS must cite at least one REQ.` → `chapter-quantified subjects are not accepted in phase 1; accepted form: Each FS must cite at least one REQ.`
- `FS-login.2 must cite at least one REQ.` → `numbered chapter subjects can detach when headings move; accepted form: FS-login must cite at least one REQ.`
- With named sections off, `FS-login.requirements must cite at least one REQ.` → `named chapter subjects require [id] named_sections = true; accepted form after enabling it: FS-login.requirements must cite at least one REQ.`
- `Each POLICY must cite at least one GOAL.` → `unknown kind "POLICY"`, then `known kinds: GOAL, REQ, FS, AR, RULE`
<!-- END chapter-rules-refused -->

Try a sentence without adding a declaration:

```bash
grund check --rule "Each FS should have exactly one security chapter." --suggestions
```

List the units a subject denotes:

```bash
grund list --selector FS.requirements
grund list --selector FS.requirements --format json
```

Configured syntax failures are located `invalid-rule` findings; `--rule`
syntax/vocabulary failures stop before scanning with exit 2. A syntactically
valid missing literal, such as `FS-missing`, is resolved after scanning and is
an `invalid-rule` finding with exit 1.

Findings sort bytewise by path, line, then message. Two identical declarations
collapse semantically and name sorted authorities, for example
`(RULE-a, RULE-b)`. If an existing `[citations]` entry says the same bare-kind
rule, the existing config finding wins byte-for-byte and no rule tail is added.
