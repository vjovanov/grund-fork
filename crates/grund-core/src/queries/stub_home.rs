/// declaration of `id` in the stub's target `file`, found by the ID on whichever
/// line it sits and never at the stub's own line. That is the scanned record
/// when the walk reached `file`. When it did not, it is the record the scanner's
/// own pass over `file` produces, read from the editor's overlay where there is
/// one, by the resolver's reading that `check`'s section lookup takes too
/// (§AR-resolver.5, §FS-check.3.2.1).
///
/// An unscanned target holding two inline declarations of `id` is refused as
/// `ambiguous ID` at their sites, as the scanned tree refuses it (§FS-show.2.2.1),
/// rather than read from the first.
///
/// A target that cannot be read, or whose pass yields no inline declaration of
/// `id`, leaves the stub's own record. So does a target the scan does not read, by
/// its name or its extension, however many headings of `id` it holds: it declares
/// nothing (§FS-declarations.checks.broken-stub.3). refs makes no stub check, so
/// every refs query on a stub's ID, bare or with a section, reaches this for a
/// broken stub and lists its citations (§FS-refs.4.1). `show` has already refused a
/// broken stub (§FS-show.2.3.4), judged on this same overlay-first text
/// (§FS-declarations.checks.broken-stub.1) of a file the scan reads, so it reaches
/// this only where that line test finds a declaration the scanner's pass does not
/// record. The two read fences alike (§FS-declarations.checks.broken-stub.2): a
/// heading inside a fenced block or a raw-text HTML block of a Markdown target
/// declares nothing to either.
