//! The checker component (§AR-system.2.6): the `Report` a run's `Catalog`
//! produce — errors, warnings and suggestions, each rule one pass over part of
//! the findings (§FS-check). It consumes `Catalog`, reads a file's text after
//! the scan only in the rules §AR-checker.placement lists, and knows no frontend.
//! Design: §AR-checker, declared in `report.rs` on the entry point the whole
//! component exists to answer.
//!
//! The module boundary is what §AR-system.4 asks for: an item another component
//! reads is re-exported below, and everything else is the component's own
//! (§AR-core-module-layout.1.1). The submodules are the former `checker*` category
//! files, one per rule family §AR-checker.2 names, plus `support.rs` for what
//! every rule shares — the hint and the report's order. The
//! inline citation style rule came the other way, up out of
//! `grammar/inline_note_layout.rs`, which is where a checker rule sat while both
//! were file-name categories (§AR-system.2.1).
//!
//! What the component does **not** hold any more: five path keys and one
//! `[[kinds]]` lookup that the flat layout parked in `homes.rs` and
//! `grounding.rs`, which the scanner below read upward, went down into `model/`
//! and `config/`, and the candidate joiner went down into `workspace/` and on
//! into `resolver/` with the clause that reads it. Two more went down when
//! §AR-system.2.10 became a component: `is_stub_for_inline_decl` into
//! `model/records.rs`, a predicate over a `Declaration` beside the stub target
//! it resolves, and the resolver of §AR-resolver.1 itself — the
//! citation-to-target lookup with the `WorkspaceCheckTarget` pair it answers
//! with, which every rule here now reads downward and which the grammar's
//! shorthand resolution had been reading upward out of this component
//! (§AR-system.4). The broken-stub rule's reading of a stub's target followed,
//! out of `homes.rs` into `scanner/stub_homes.rs`, when the scan came to record
//! each stub's home with it (§AR-scanner.4.6): one reading, so the stub that rule
//! accepts is the stub the count of homes pairs.
//!
//! `plural`, the plural `s` a count earns, came here from the writers' template
//! renderer with §AR-system.2.8 and left again with §AR-system.2.11: the
//! managed block's budget sentence is the templates' now, and neither reader
//! sits below the other, so the spelling is `model/text.rs` and this component
//! reads it downward (§AR-system.4).
