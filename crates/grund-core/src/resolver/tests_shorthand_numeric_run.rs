//! Test module: the numeric-run rule — a marked shorthand glued to a second
//! number is a numeral, not a citation (§FS-fmt.2.4.1, §FS-check.3.15,
//! §DF-shorthand-numeric-run).
//!
//! One module for one rule, across every stage it has to hold at: what `fmt`
//! refuses to rewrite, what `check` says about the site instead, and what the
//! editor's live transform does with a run already on the line. That grouping is
//! the point — the defect this rule fixes was a rewrite and a report agreeing
//! with each other and both being wrong, so the cases that would catch it again
//! have to fail together and be read together.
