//! The one function that maps a citation to the project it resolves against
//! (§AR-system.2.10, §AR-resolver.1): the target's `Catalog` and the `Schema`
//! and `Compiled` grammar its ID is parsed and rendered with, or `None` when the alias is unknown
//! (§FS-workspace.1.2, §FS-workspace.8).
//!
//! Every consumer of citations goes through here rather than matching on
//! `citation.namespace` itself, which is what keeps `check`, the editor jump and
//! every query command agreeing on what "qualified" means (§AR-resolver.1). A
//! `None` return is never a silent skip: the calling rule turns it into a
//! located diagnostic (§AR-resolver.2).
//!
//! It sat in `checker/support.rs` with the rules that call it, which had the
//! grammar's shorthand resolution reading the target record upward out of the
//! checker (§AR-system.4). The record is a pair of borrows and the function a
//! map lookup — neither is a rule — so both belong to the component that holds
//! the loaded set they are borrowed from.
