//! The grammar component (§AR-system.2.1): the lexical facts every other
//! component shares — the ID grammar compiled from `[id] format` and its
//! near-miss detection, comment-line and comment-block recognition,
//! fenced-block boundaries, the number-only shorthand, inline-note layout, the
//! never-rewrite predicates and the formatter's own syntax — its cross-reference
//! wrapper and its suppression directives (§FS-fmt.2.3, §FS-fmt.2.5). It
//! consumes text and knows no
//! file, no rule and no frontend — and no `Config` either: what config decides
//! reaches here as the compiled `Grammar` and the `LexicalSettings` record
//! beside it, both built above and only read here (`settings.rs`,
//! §AR-system.2.1, §AR-system.4).
//!
//! The module boundary is what §AR-system.4 asks for: an item another component
//! reads is re-exported below, and everything else is the component's own
//! (§AR-core-module-layout.1.1). The submodules are the former `grammar*`,
//! `markdown_fence`, `comment_line`, `comment_block`, `shorthand`,
//! `inline_note_layout`, `never_rewrite` and ID-grammar category files, one per
//! lexical fact §AR-system.2.1 names. Four items the flat layout parked in
//! scanner files came down here when §AR-system.2.5 became a module: the
//! off-grammar `LegacyGrammar`, the `{kind}` literal reader of the `[id] format`
//! template, the member-local fallback ID parser, and the qualified-citation
//! suppression rule. Three went the other way. The inline citation style rule is
//! the checker's (§AR-checker.2.14), and so is the finding a shorthand site
//! earns (§FS-check.3.13) — what stays here is the classifier both stages read.
//! And the shorthand asked of a whole run's catalog is the resolver's
//! (§AR-resolver.4): recognizing the shape is lexical, resolving it against
//! every loaded project's declarations is not.
//!
//! Five items came down out of the writers when §AR-system.2.8 became a module.
//! `anchors.rs` is the whole of the former `fmt_link_anchors.rs` plus the
//! section-heading text the scanner read upward to fill a stored section title:
//! deriving an anchor from heading text is a renderer's slugger reproduced
//! byte-for-byte (§DF-github-anchor-fidelity), which is lexical and no part of a
//! writer's plan. The ID renderer and its qualified form joined `ids.rs`, which
//! also took the record of one marked citation found on a Markdown line
//! (§AR-system.4).
//!
//! Two more came down when §AR-system.2.11 became a component and the
//! formatter's own syntax stopped being the formatter's alone.
//! `fmt_cross_refs.rs` is the `--cross-refs` wrapper read backwards
//! (§DF-show-cross-ref-flattening) with the label predicate that decides
//! whether a `[…](…)` label is a citation at all, which the scanner had parked
//! in `legacy.rs` for it and which is private now that both are one file; `fmt_suppress.rs` is the two scopes §FS-fmt.2.5 takes
//! out of a rewrite's reach. Recognizing a wrapper and recognizing a directive
//! are both lexical, and while they sat above, the editor's on-type rule and
//! three readers of a flattened body reached sideways or upward for them
//! (§FS-lsp.1.4, §AR-system.4).
//!
//! `managed_block.rs` came down with the rest of §AR-system.2.8: finding the
//! block grund owns inside somebody else's document and reading the `vN` version
//! it carries is lexical, and it was implemented twice up there — once for the
//! agent entrypoint (§FS-init.2.3) and once for a client dotfile
//! (§FS-integrations.4.1) — while the checker's agent-entrypoint rule read the
//! first copy upward (§FS-check.3.5). Both copies are here now, so all three
//! callers read one module downward; what differs between them is in that file's
//! own doc comment.
//!
//! `section_paths.rs` is the newest, and came here for the same reason: whether
//! one section coordinate lies beneath another is a fact about the section
//! grammar and its component boundary (§FS-config.3.3.4), and both readers of
//! it sit above — `grund refs --descendants` in the api (§FS-refs.2) and the
//! declaration-side title in the editor queries (§FS-lsp.1.3.1). Written twice
//! it would be written wrong once, so it is written here.
