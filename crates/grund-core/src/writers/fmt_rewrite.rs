//! Citation normalization (§FS-fmt.2): one pass over a document that rewrites
//! triggers to markers, marks bare citations, expands shorthands, and keeps
//! cross-reference links current. The modes share the traversal — each line is
//! asked every question once — so what lives here is the walk and the per-line
//! decisions inside it. The link construction §FS-fmt.6 needs is
//! `fmt_links.rs`, the two suppressed scopes of §FS-fmt.2.5 are
//! `grammar/fmt_suppress.rs` — recognizing them is lexical, and the editor's
//! on-type rule reads the same two records (§FS-lsp.1.4.3). The command surface
//! lives in `grund-cli`; this engine file only returns edits
//! (§AR-system.2.9.1).
//!
//! Named for the rewrite rather than for the category, because the category is
//! the `writers/` directory now (§AR-core-module-layout.1). Tree and scope
//! orchestration, including §FS-fmt.6.6's auto-enable pair, lives in the
//! cohesive `fmt_tree.rs` sibling (§AR-core-module-layout.1.5).
