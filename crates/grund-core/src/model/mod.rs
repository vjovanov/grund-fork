//! The model component (§AR-system.2.2): the data every other component passes
//! along — `Catalog`, `Declaration`, `Citation` and `Report`, plus the value
//! records (§FS-values.2). It consumes nothing and is types plus tiny helpers,
//! so it knows nothing of the tree, the rules or a frontend. The `Config` record
//! sat here while config was a file-name category and is config's own since
//! §AR-system.2.3 became a module; the grounding-structure records `Catalog`
//! carries came the other way, out of the scanner, when §AR-system.2.5 became
//! one (§AR-scanner.2.7).
//!
//! The module boundary is what §AR-system.4 asks for: an item another component
//! reads is re-exported below, and everything else is the component's own
//! (§AR-core-module-layout.1.1). The submodules are the former `model*` and
//! `values` category files, one per record family §AR-system.2.2 names, plus
//! `paths.rs`: the path keys a file is compared by, which came down out of
//! `checker/homes.rs` when §AR-system.2.6 became a module because the scanner
//! read five of them upward (§AR-system.4).
//!
//! Three things came the same way when §AR-system.2.9 became a module, each
//! because a component below the deprecated path was reading it upward. The
//! report's path spellings and the JSON escape joined `paths.rs` and a new
//! `text.rs`, out of the `output` category: `format_path`, `sort_path_key`,
//! `relative_from_base`, `json_escape` and `format_list`, every one a function
//! of a string or a `Path` with no stream and no `Config`. The published report
//! records — `Report`, `Finding` and `FindingSite` — joined `report.rs` beside
//! the internal ones they are rendered from, because the editor snapshot and the
//! show refusal of §FS-lsp and §FS-errors.5.2 carry them and both are the queries'.
//! And the snapshot canonicalization of §AR-lsp.5 joined `paths.rs` out of
//! `scanner/tree.rs`, the queries and the writers being siblings that both
//! rebase a path against it.
