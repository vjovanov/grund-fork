# Examples

Self-contained mini-repos demonstrating each ID scheme `grund` supports.
Each subfolder is shaped like an `tests/e2e/cases/<name>/` directory — `repo/`
holds the fixture, and `expected.exit`/`expected.stdout`/`expected.stderr`
record the contract — so each example doubles as a regression fixture.
The e2e test runner also runs `grund <repo>` against every example on `cargo
test`, so the snippets below cannot drift from what the tool actually does.

Examples are maintained as user-facing walkthroughs for canonical `grund`
workflows, per [FS-examples](../docs/functional-spec/FS-examples.md).
Each example README should name the use-case it teaches, show the command to
run, explain the expected output, and call out the practical trade-offs.
Runnable examples share the same golden-output runner as `tests/e2e/cases/`; the
examples tree should not grow a parallel test harness.

## ID schemes

| Folder                                                       | `[id] format`             | Example IDs                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| [`scheme-numbered-slug/`](scheme-numbered-slug/)             | `{kind}-{number}-{slug}`  | `FS-001-login`             |
| [`scheme-numbered/`](scheme-numbered/)                       | `{kind}-{number}`         | `RFC-001`, `FS-002`        |
| [`scheme-slug/`](scheme-slug/)                               | `{kind}-{slug}`           | `FS-login`, `AR-event-bus` |

Each subfolder's `README.md` lists the trade-offs for that scheme. The
[structure guide](../docs/user-facing/structure.md)
summarizes when to reach for each.

## Workflows

| Folder                                                       | Use-case                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| [`workspace/`](workspace/)                                   | Cross-project citation in a monorepo ([§FS-workspace](../docs/functional-spec/FS-workspace.md#fs-workspace-grund-validates-cross-project-citations-in-a-workspace)) |
| [`rules/`](rules/)                                           | Controlled-English rules over declarations, named chapters, and citations ([§FS-rules](../docs/functional-spec/FS-rules.md#fs-rules-grounded-declarations-state-and-enforce-chapter-rules)) |
| [`values/`](values/)                                         | Markdown/JSON value declarations and explicit consistency bindings ([§FS-values](../docs/functional-spec/FS-values.md#fs-values-opted-in-kinds-bind-authored-components-to-one-declared-value)) |
| [`external-tickets/`](external-tickets/)                     | Explicitly materialized external facts resolved from committed snapshots ([§FS-fetch](../docs/functional-spec/FS-fetch.md#fs-fetch-grund-materializes-one-external-fact-snapshot)) |
| [`cochange/`](cochange/) | Opt-in Git/CI evidence of related spec and test edits ([§FS-cochange-recipe.examples](../docs/functional-spec/FS-cochange-recipe.md#examples-maintained-walkthrough-tests-and-opt-in-guidance)) |

The [Python API workflow](python-api/) embeds the same engine using a local
extension installation ([§FS-distribution.3.3.7](../docs/functional-spec/FS-distribution.md#337-local-source-and-typing-handoff)); its native acceptance
coverage is in the shared binding corpus.

## Run an example

The [Node API consumer](node-api/) is tested through a fresh packed-package
installation ([§FS-distribution.3.2.4](../docs/functional-spec/FS-distribution.md#324-acceptance-evidence));
follow its README and the [Node guide](../docs/user-facing/node-api.md).
Its consumer capture uses the existing json-report fixture.

From the repo root, with a built `grund` binary on `$PATH` (or invoked
via `cargo run --`):

```bash
grund examples/scheme-slug/repo
echo $?    # 0
```

A passing scheme prints `success` on stdout and exits 0.
